1. Introduction
    - Purpose: Pagotometer is a mobile app that helps users discover nearby ice cream shops.
    - Intended audience: People who want ice cream and are willing to use an app to find an ice cream shop.
    - Intended use: Mobile users will rely on Pagotometer to find the location of an ice cream shop that serves their needs.
    - Scope: Pagotometer v1 will only represent a dozen ice cream shops in Seattle, and only 2-3 flavors per shop.
    - Definitions and Acronyms: the name Pagotometer is derived from combining the Greek words for ice cream (*pagoto*) and measure (*meter*). 
2. Overview
    - User needs
        - Accurate: Because ice cream is a seasonal treat, the menus for different shops tend to fluctuate seasonally, if not weekly/daily. Users are relying on the data to be accurate and up-to-date in order to help inform their choice of where to go. 
        - Low friction: users should be able to find the answer to their question "where should I go to get the ice cream that I want?" within 5 minutes of using the app.
        - Low barrier to entry: users should not have to go through any tutorials to learn how to use the compass.
        - Responsive: user experience of the compass should be satisfying and informative, which will be dependent on the smoothness of animations and responsiveness of the app.
    - Assumptions and dependencies: Pagotometer v1 will be tested on an iPhone, so I am assuming that my users have a device that is comparable in terms of hardware. I'm also assuming that users are willing to share their location data with my app, which is necessary in order to calculate the distance and direction of an ice cream shop. 
3. Features and Requirements
    - System
        - iPhone? 
        - GPS enabled? : potential to show a default location so users can at least see a list of ice cream shops of indeterminate distance/direction, therefor reducing the need for location-service permissions.
    - Functional Requirements
    - Other/Nonfunction Requirements
