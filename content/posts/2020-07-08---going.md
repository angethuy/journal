description: "the one in which Angela decides to write the Netlify function in Go instead of Javascript and successfully gets data from the Airtable API"
---

### Done today:
- read through the Netlify documentation for writing functions and discovered we can write them in JS or Go 
- installed Go and read through some of the documentation 
- found a cool [Airtable API client for Go](https://github.com/brianloveswords/airtable) 
- wrote a test function in Go and compiled it 

### Proud moment

IT WORKS! Relatively simple with the help of the Airtable client but the next challenge to tackle will be integrating the code into a Netlify function.

### Pain point 

Discovered that reinstalling yarn dependencies fetches the original source files for Lumen blog generator and overwrites all my modifications, which I had been adding locally. This time, I forked the original repo, pushed my modifications, and swapped out the repo link in the package.json file. I hope this persists my changes to the package for the remainder of the project.
